conservative,Reddit has been completely taken over by bots and bad actors from outside the US,"Not that this sub isn’t well aware at this point. There were glimpses of this during Trumps first term, but it became painfully obvious during the last campaign and now his second term that foreign countries now fully understand just how powerful Reddit is at causing dissension in America, and seek to gain something and weaken our trust in each other by doing so. It’s literally become the online epicenter for bad actors to spread misinformation.  

I can’t even go to subs about cool art or music now without the top comments calling republicans Nazis and fascists and Putin sympathizers. 

I guess I’m saying this as a reminder that when you see these kinds of comments that have thousands of upvotes, especially in subs that have absolutely nothing to do with politics, it’s almost a guarantee at this point that it’s coming from an account that wants to harm America or escalate global conflict for their own benefit in some way.

liberal,"Trump should not presume that this terrible terrorist attack in NY will divert our nation's attention from his Russia investigation. No matter what happens in this country or any new wars abroad that he wages in future, he has to resign like Nixon did on August 8,1974.","Before I go any further on my support of the move that Mr. Mueller has taken so far nailing three of Trump's big campaign advisers,mainly Paul Manafort, my heart goes out to the families of eight people who lost their lives in a rampage by a resident who came from Uzbekistan in 2010.

But if we look around and try to figure out who gets the most benefits from this particular terrorist attack, we can easily figure out that it's not the I.S.I.S. or any other terror organizations.

But Mr. Trump himself.

Just on the day when the entire nation's attention was converged on the screens of the tv., and the nation's leading newspapers, watching and reading  the news of Trump's impending Nixon like resignation,""Boom"" a resident from a far away country closer to Russia rammed his rental truck on the innocent cyclists riding their bikes on the bike paths in Manhattan in New York.

Now if we pour through our recent history books, we'll find many instances all over the world when the leader of a nation with the powers to abuse given by the Senate and the House of Representatives of their nations caused similar terrorist acts to happen deliberately in their countries by paying money to some foreign nationals to kill the innocent people of the leaders' own countries.

So, in this particular terrorist attack in NY yesterday we're not naive to figure out who actually gained by this heinous act.

Nobody but Trump himself.

Yes, Trump who is ready to fire Robert Mueller and pardon himself and others snared in this Russia investigation any time with the advise of Sean Hannity and other conservative personalities like Pat Robertson, has every reasons to cheer when he looks out on the television screens in the White House and sees with delight that his impending doomsday is hijacked by a lone terrorist from Uzbekistan .

And if it goes on like this when one terrorist act after another is caused by some terrorists from Muslim countries, Trump can easily raise his poll numbers by double digits by saying,"" I told you so. Muslims are no good. Now all you idiots who doubted me before, should support my move immediately to shut down the entry of all the Muslims coming to this country just like what I said on a campaign stop in 2015 and also in 2016.""

But what Trump doesn't yet understand or he has no intention to fathom that we the citizens of this country who didn't vote for him in the last election are not so stupid and racists like most of his uneducated and under educated supporters are who believed all his lies before and will believe again and again any bullshit that he invents to please his flock by trying to present himself as one of those messiahs who came before him on this earth.

But what he doesn't know that we in the left know that everything he says in on a day to day basis in his life is nothing but another form of B.S. wrapped up in different shapes that he uses mainly to make asses out of his totally stupid and completely racist followers.

Yes, we the Democrats, the Liberals and the Progressives know exactly who he is inside : a con man.

And that is the reason why he should know that this country will not tolerate another ""Saturday Night Massacre' that happened on October 20,1973 during the Watergate scandal. 

If he fires Mr. Mueller and pardons himself and everyone, that the Special Counsel has already snared and many of his campaign staffers who were involved in direct 'collusion' with the Russians in making him win the last election whom the F.B.I. Agents are about to arrest any day now, Trump will  feel the wrath of the leftist movements with mass demonstrations all over the country and the loudest honking of the cars in front of the White House which will be much more intense than what Nixon had to bear before he resigned.","Trump should not presume that this terrible terrorist attack in NY will divert our nation's attention from his Russia investigation.

liberal,"As long as Trump stays in power, we should abide by the Code Red because there is no other person who can destroy America other than Him. Even I.S.I.S. could not do more damage to our democracy than Trump who's under Russian influence because of how he'd desecrated a Moscow hotel room in 2013.","Yes, if ever there is an existential threat to our great country, it is now. 

That is the reason why an article in today's NYT by Thomas Friedman,""Sounding Code Red : Electing the Trump Resistance"" is right on the money.

We all thought before Trump stole the last election right in front of our own eyes with the help of the Russians that our democracy was on solid footing. 


We also thought that there was no need to sound alarm or for flashing ""Code Red"" unless our president was Richard Nixon who in 1973 caused the famous ""Saturday Night Massacre"" all by himself just to destroy the democratic ideals that this country grew up with after our early politicians wrote the Constitution.

But with Trump's arrival in the political scene the entire democratic process of our country has fallen to the lowest level.

Any American who was old enough to witness first hand Nixon's trampling of the democracy like few of us, didn't expect to see again how another president called Trump undermined the office of the presidency since Jan 20th, 2017.

Trump with his horrendous hyperbole decimating a certain percentage of Americans with Mexican heritage with crude and dangerous pronouncements saying in a criminal's voice and tone while announcing his presidential  campaign on a June afternoon in 2015.

What followed after he opened his dirty tongue in the basement of the Trump Tower was the worst lie any presidential candidate ever uttered when he said this in a public forum "" the Mexicans are bringing drugs...."" and promised to his racist supporters that he'd stop all the Mexicans coming to America by building ""a beautiful Wall on the southern border. And Mexico will pay for it.""

Now after he fast tracked to the present time, Trump figured out that if Mexico built the wall, there is no money to be made by his Trump Inc. 

No wonder he's asking for a whopping $18 billion from the Congress that ultimately will be paid by us, the American taxpayers.

But thanks to our leftist members of Congress who've flashed ""Code Red"" the day he was selected by much fewer American citizens compared to Hillary 3+ million more, Trump is at his worst twitter behavior blasting every Americans except his 40+ million racist supporters because he figured out that he missed out on a high percentage of the bribes that he was ready to make from the huge costs of building ""that beautiful wall"" that he proposed to his Republican cohorts in the capitol.","As long as Trump stays in power, we should abide by the Code Red because there is no other person who can destroy America other than Him.
