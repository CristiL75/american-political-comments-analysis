conservative,The complete lack of response to DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson's anti-Semitic social media posts has finally pushed me over to Conservatism.,"I have always considered myself fairly ""centrist"". While I have  had some conservative leanings, namely support of Israel as a Jew, I have had mostly left-leaning social views. Most recently, this meant that I supported the message of BLM. While I was far from marching in the streets, I accepted their movement and supported their message of equality. However, these last few days have shown me that, at least according to BLM ""leadership"" and prominent black voices, all lives do not, in fact, matter. DeSean Jackson of the Philadelphia Eagles posted to social media a quote attributed to Hitler, claiming that Jews are what keep black people ""down"". Now, I know that in every large group, there are a few crazies. I was not about to abandon my support for BLM because of the actions of one man. Then, former NBA player Steven Jackson came out in support of his comments, claiming that Jews are part of a global conspiracy to disenfranchise Black Americans.

He doubled down.

He tripled down.

And you know what the response from the NBA, NFL, and BLM has been?

Silence.

I have seen one response from a current player condemning these hateful comments. Steven A Smith couldn't address the issue on ESPN without saying ""George Floyd"" half a dozen times. The leagues, the players, the media, has said basically nothing about this at all. These are the same people that shrieked at Drew Brees for stating he thought people should stand for the national anthem. Yet, when confronted by an actual racist opinion, because it comes from one of their own, they are completely silent. BLM likes to use the phrase ""silence is violence"" to describe what they view as complicit behavior on the part of those who do not actively campaign for their cause. Yet their own prominent voices have nothing to say about flat out racism, because this time it came from someone they share a skin color with. This has shown me, about as clearly as possible, that they don't actually care about anyone but themselves. Just like the members of any extremist movement, they and their ilk can do no wrong, and if they did, it was ""misinterpreted"". The thin veneer of a desire for equality has been shown as a desire for power and control. The ""left"" has told me for years that I should give special treatment to those that are different from me, because they have struggles I couldn't understand. But, when it comes down to brass tacks, it's clear they don't give a shit about anyone but themselves. Despite Jews helping the civil rights movement. Despite Jews being founding members of the NAACP. Despite Jews being lynched by the Klan alongside them in the summer of 1964.

I'm not asking for them to get down on their knees and grovel to me for forgiveness. All I've ever wanted out of this situation was a public condemnation. A statement saying ""this is not what we stand for"".  None of these organizations could spare a minute or paragraph to publicly condemn Mr. Jackson. I guess Jews aren't a big enough demographic to spend time pandering to anymore.","The complete lack of response to DeSean Jackson and Stephen Jackson's anti-Semitic social media posts has finally pushed me over to Conservatism.

conservative,I went to the Trump rally at MSG! Sharing my experience and take aways! ‚úäÔ∏èüá∫üá≤,"Im a minority women, a catholic, and lifelong conservative who currently lives in Manhattan. I went to see President Trump at MSG on Sunday. It was my first political rally/event of any kind. Here are some of my observations and take aways if you're interested so you dont have to rely on the media (sorry its long)!

First and foremost WOW! Omgggg the turnout! I severely underestimated his level of support here. I figured i could leave an hour before and walk in to get a seat. No, lol. When I registered for tickets it said the event started at 7, I planned on leaving at 6. So at 445 when i see an article that trump takes the stage at 5, i jump off the couch and skeedaddle over. Luckily i live close to msg. I bought a cute hat and sweatshirt to wear. First time in my life ive worn anything remotely political, but i thought it was important to show that there are full on supporters and not just rally observers in nyc. Also a note that the crowd greatly filled in for a good 2 hours after me. I think the 7pm messaging kept a lot of ppl including me from coming earlier.

I arrive at 515pm. Theres hundreds of cops as the streets outside msg are blocked off. An officer tells me they stopped letting ppl into msg a long time ago, but there are multiple sectioned off areas outside where we can watch on a screen. So i head to the closest area. Tulsi Gabbard is speaking (love her and her evolution ü§ç). I join the crush of people and after an hour im able to scooch all the way up to the corner of 7th/fashion ave. Its PAKCED. You cant move, crammed in. People around me talked about getting in line 4, 5, 6 hours early and still not getting inside. Then i found out some people showed up the night before and camped out! 

Had it not been for the ppl in the crowd i would have just gone home. Bc the screen was blocked by a tree (multiple crowd chants to MOVE THAT TREE lol) and you could hardly hear a thing (except dana whiteüòÜ). Many ppl watching along on their phone for volume. But the vibe was unmatched. Hard to describe. So much enthusiasm. All creeds/colors. Everyone chatting and joking with the ppl around them. In front of me a boomer teamster chatting with a young arab kid draped in an American flag and his mom, and he joked with a gen z hispanic supporter on his other side the rest of the night. Multiply by 100. Everyone was just happy. It was a super communal atmosphere. Cheesy but true. Multiple comments about anger and outrage not being present here. Also the weather was really nice.

For the first half the crowd was about an even 50/50 split- half white half various shades of black and brown. DO NOT let anyone tell you minorities hate trump. Harris might take more of the overall minority vote than trump but i think we'll see the highest recorded numbers of minorities voting for trump than any other republican candidate in history. Same with the overall NYC and NY vote counts. Surprising to me were the insanely high numbers of orthodox and non orthodox jews. Even jewish people were talking about it. When i arrived id say at least, at least 20% of the crowd was outwardly jewish meaning identifiable dress or adornments, so the actual number was likely way higher. Also very surprising to me were the number of arab supporters. Saw palestine for trump signs. I didnt expect to see that. For the first time ever i saw a significant number of east asians in trump gear. Mostly men but a few women came with them. Also shocking the number of EASL chinese immigrants who showed up. All aged 50s+. Under represented were indian people. I saw a couple young guys in maga hats who looked like your average crypto bros. Saw 0 indian women. Also slightly underrepresented imo given the location...hispanics. Im told lots of hispanic supporters inside but outside the jewish supporters easily outnumbered hispanic by a large margin. At least where i was standing, but it didnt look different when i had to walk through the crowd to leave. To note the jewish orthodox supporters left early, many did not stay through the log jam of speakers, but I can confirm they were there early and in huge numbers. Black men showed up for trump, but I only saw 3 black women. The crowd was about 60-70% millennial/gen z aka under 40 with significant gen z representation. I saw 1 child. About a 60/40 split of men/women. I asked everyone around me where they were from. Was pleasantly surprised it was mostly the 5 boroughs. 2nd after that was LI. One guy came down from Boston.  I didnt meet anyone from NJ which I thought i would have.

There was only 1 agitator in the crowd. I think white guy with a small sign that simply said ""34 convictions"". He got a couples laughs and boos, but it was all very lighthearted and jokey. No one was aggressive, rude, or vulgar with him and he stayed longer than i did lol.

I stayed for 3.5 hours. My phone died otherwise i probably would have stayed until trump finished speaking even though i couldnt hear him. Im really glad i got to experience a rally. I would absolutely go again, and I would go early to try and get a seat. Chatting with a couple other attendees we discussed how no other politician from any party could draw such a crowd and amount of enthusiasm like this in nyc. Not a single one. Love him or hate him, trump has the IT factor and ppl show up to witness it. 

Lastly I'll end with snippets of my convos and those around me. Gave me a really interesting perspective on why people from such different backgrounds showed up and are voting for trump.

Man, chinese, 50s-ish, EASL Queens- 
>biden voter but ""kamala is just too far left"". However hes greatly concerned about tariffs as tariffs ""raise prices"" and ""theyre very hard to remove once theyre in place""

Gen z arab american LI- 
>""i was always liberal until i did my own research. One of my friends is super liberal now every time i go over to her house shes mad at me""

Jewish lady 50s Brooklyn- 
>appalled at bidens stance on gaza and also appalled at the abandonment of hurricane helene victims by the federal govt

Many first time jewish trump voters discussing the obvious reason: 
>Gaza/anti semitism. And again i really need to drive home not only the presence of jewish voters but the ENTHUSIASM they had. Most around me were livestreaming their attendance. 

Black gen z son and his black probably gen x father-
>""HELL YEA we love trump""   

Two very young jewish girls behind me about 18-21ish Brooklyn (so young i had to explain to them who hulk hogan was lol)- 
>""i just said i dont want to marry anyone super political and now here i am at a trump rally"" as they erupted in giggles"" üòÇüíô

White guy 50s queens- 
>""we just want even tariffs"" also said ""why not give him a shot cant be worse than what we just had""

Discussion between multiple gen z/millenial asian and hispanic men and 1 black man (bronx/manhattan/possibly other boroughs)-
>about how no one voted for her and how you dont deserve to be the pres nominee on a ticket if youve never won a primary and how tulsi gabbard ended her last pres bid over marijuana.

Gen z hispanic kid Manhattan- 
>""if she wins this country is cooked""


I know theres more but honestly im forgetting already bc it happened on sun. Oh and i was only heckled once. When i left i was waiting at the light to cross. This lady next to me was staring, i thought for a cab. Nope, at my hat. She was like YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. Then she went off about it isnt worth it, my life, my rights, hes a fascist, i cant believe it etc etc... I actually felt bad for her, she sincerely sounded distraught. I just told her things would be ok then kept moving. Honestly though, im not sure shes ok.

Enjoy some pics and videos of my view and ps thats me in the TRUMP WAS RIGHT ABOUT EVERYTHING hat. Covered my face tho bc reddit is unhinged lmao üíÄ

Guys, if im lying im dying! If you get the opportunity to attend a rally, i highly suggest it. It was fun, positive, and i left feeling really hopeful ‚ù§üá∫üá≤
